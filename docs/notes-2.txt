3. why do "unphysical hard scatterings" happen? why do we need softening? i know it's because we're thinking of it as a discrete space/time field, but what exactly about it creates the problem? the fact that we're computing forces at not fine enough steps. if we computed forces at increasingly small steps, everything would be fine, but then it would take infinite time :)
