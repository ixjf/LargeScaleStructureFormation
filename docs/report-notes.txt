(AVALIAÇÃO) 6. halo mass function for each recorded time (settings for halo finding?), most massive halo for each recorded time (velocities, for example; but i didn't store velocities in the snapshot file!) - verifying the resolution and accuracy; matter correlation function - confirming what i see from visual comparison
(AVALIAÇÃO) does the total energy of the system stay more or less conserved? what are the timesteps required by the usual timestep criteria and what timestep did I use? what can we learn from the results of this random simulation? can it even say anything at all? it does not replicate any real system, they're random initial conditions.
